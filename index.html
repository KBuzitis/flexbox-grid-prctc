                    A gentle reminder: If you think you have rights because of the government, you are a victim of propaganda, my friend. You have rights because you are a living thing. A government only seeks to take them away and then conditionally give them back, as long as you do what they tell you to do. The only difference between a government and a street gang is length of establishment, and size. Without somebody there to forbid it, there would be no such thing as forbidden knowledge. Learn as much as you can, regardless of where it comes from. <br><span id="names">- Nate (@gaptooth._)</span>
