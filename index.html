                Don't let people tell you your attraction to fire is "abnormal" or "hazardous." Prometheus doesn't have his liver eaten every day for you to ignore the allure of arson.

                A gentle reminder: If you think you have rights because of the government, you are a victim of propaganda, my friend. You have rights because you are a living thing. A government only seeks to take them away and then conditionally give them back, as long as you do what they tell you to do. The only difference between a government and a street gang is length of establishment, and size. Without somebody there to forbid it, there would be no such thing as forbidden knowledge. Learn as much as you can, regardless of where it comes from. <br>- Nate (@gaptooth._)

                I will follow you everywhere - to the dusty corners of childhood, to every downfall and resurrection. Till your skin becomes my skin. <br>- Tishani Doshi<br><br>
                Love, your blood was spilling in cascades, / and I couldn't wipe it away, couldn't clean it up, no, / no, my palms turned cups and oh, I gulped. <br>- Eibhlin Dubh Ni Chonaill
